# User engagement

One key area where companies become concerned and willing to exploit data to get guidance on where the problems are lying or how they can be solved, is related to customer retention or user engagement.

So, let's imagine that we are analysts working for a technological company whose most important KPI revolves around how customers are using its main product. A product that is a sort of an intranet social network within the workplace where a user can send and receive individual or group messages, like them, share documents, check inbox, post ideas, and search for info from other users of the same company. We will call it "Hub" moving on for simplification purposes.

Hub is sold to several companies around the world so that its employees have communication tools available. They can make use of it for free but the companies pay fees to enable that.
